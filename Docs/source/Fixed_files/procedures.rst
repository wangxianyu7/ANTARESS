Tutorials
=========

The following pages contain step-by-step tutorials to use ``ANTARESS`` to its full capabilities. 

First, read how to `get started <https://obswww.unige.ch/~bourriev/antaress/doc/html/Fixed_files/getting_started.html>`_ with the workflow.
``ANTARESS`` tutorials detail how to process and analyze datasets for various purposes, by customizing the settings of the `default configuration file <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/src/antaress/ANTARESS_launch/ANTARESS_settings.py>`_  that you should have copied in your working directory.
Although the tutorials are quite exhaustive, additional options are available in the configuration file so do not hesitate to read it in details. 

A dedicated `plots tutorial <https://obswww.unige.ch/~bourriev/antaress/doc/html/Fixed_files/procedures_plots/procedures_plots.html>`_ will help you customize ``ANTARESS`` plots using the plot configuration file (which you should also have copied in your working directory from the `default plot configuration file <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/src/antaress/ANTARESS_plots/ANTARESS_plot_settings.py>`_)
