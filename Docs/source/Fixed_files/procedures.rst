Tutorials
=========

The following pages contain step-by-step tutorials to use ``ANTARESS`` to its full capabilities. 
First, read how to `get started <https://obswww.unige.ch/~bourriev/antaress/doc/html/Fixed_files/getting_started.html>`_ with the workflow.
``ANTARESS`` tutorials detail how to carry out a specific procedure using the configuration file (which you should have copied in your working directory from the `default configuration file <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/src/antaress/ANTARESS_launch/ANTARESS_settings.py>`_). 
Although the tutorials are quite exhaustive, additional options are available in the configuration file so do not hesitate to read it in details. 
A dedicated `plots tutorial <https://obswww.unige.ch/~bourriev/antaress/doc/html/Fixed_files/procedures_plots/procedures_plots.html>`_ will help you customize ``ANTARESS`` plots using the plot configuration file (which you should also have copied in your working directory from the `default plot configuration file <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/src/antaress/ANTARESS_plots/ANTARESS_plot_settings.py>`_)
