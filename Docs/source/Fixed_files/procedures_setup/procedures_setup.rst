Workflow set-up
===============

This tutorial details how to set-up the datasets and planetary system to be processed with ``ANTARESS``.

   
Datasets
--------  

``ANTARESS`` can process observed or mock datasets, acquired or generated for multiple epochs with different spectrographs. 
Dataset settings are set up in the `configuration file <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/src/antaress/ANTARESS_launch/ANTARESS_settings.py>`_, which you should have copied in your working directory. 
A list of instruments that can be processed with the workflow, along with their specific designation, is reported in the comments of the :green:`ANTARESS_settings()` function of the configuration file.
Each visit associated with an instrument can have an arbitrary name, but it must remain consistent throughout the workflow settings.

Information about the retrieval of observed spectral time-series can be found on `this page <https://obswww.unige.ch/~bourriev/antaress/doc/html/Fixed_files/data_access.html>`_.
Once you have retrieved the data, indicate the absolute path to the directories storing each dataset with::

 gen_dic['data_dir_list']={'Instrument':{'Visit':'path'}}

Information about the generation of mock spectral time-series with ``ANTARESS`` can be found `here <https://obswww.unige.ch/~bourriev/antaress/doc/html/procedures_mock/procedures_mock.html>`_.
Once you have generated the data, make sure that the workflow is in *mock* and *retrieval* modes::
 
 gen_dic['mock_data'] = True
 gen_dic['calc_proc_data']= False
    
And indicate which visits to process through::

 mock_dic['visit_def']={'Instrument':{'Visit':{}}}

The field associated with a visit is only required when generating the mock dataset.


Planetary system
----------------

The workflow processes datasets from one stellar system at a time. Multiple planets can be processed together, transiting or not during the epoch of a given dataset.

First, open the copy of the `ANTARESS_systems.py <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/src/antaress/ANTARESS_launch/ANTARESS_systems.py>`_ file that you saved in your working directory.
The file contains a dictionary in which you define the star (:green:`Star_name`) and associated planets (:green:`Planet_b`, :green:`Planet_c`, etc) as::

 all_system_params={
    'Star_name':{
        'star':{
            'st_prop':value},  
        'Planet_b':{
            'pl_prop':value}, 
        'Planet_c':{
            'pl_prop':value},          
    }}

The star and planet names are arbitrary, but they must remain consistent throughout the workflow settings.
Properties that you must define for the star (:green:`st_prop`) and planets (:green:`pl_prop`) are described in details in the comments of the :orange:`ANTARESS_systems.py` file.

.. Tip::
   You can define as many planetary systems as you want in the :orange:`ANTARESS_systems.py` file, as the star and planets to be processed are selected through ``ANTARESS`` configuration file.

Then, in your copy of the configuration file define which star you want to process::

 gen_dic['star_name']='Star_name' 
 
And which planets you want to process::

 gen_dic['studied_pl'] = {'Planet_b':{'Instrument':['Visit']}} 
 
Because ``ANTARESS`` typically processes ground-based datasets obtained on a given night, you need to indicate for each planet in which observing epoch(s) it was observed with a given instrument.
Visit names must match those you indicated in :green:`gen_dic['data_dir_list']`.
If a planet emission or its absorption of the stellar light are negligible during an observing epoch, or do not affect the part of the data that you intend to study, there is no need to associate it to this epoch in :green:`gen_dic['studied_pl']`.

All planets that have a significant impact on the Keplerian motion of the star during the observing epochs should be defined in::

 gen_dic['kepl_pl'] = ['Planet_b','Planet_c']

The list of planets can be replaced by :green:`'all'` to directly account for all planets set up in the :orange:`ANTARESS_systems.py` file.

.. Tip::
   If a planet induces a constant reflex motion of its star during an observing epoch, for example if it has a long orbital period, it does not need be defined in :green:`gen_dic['kepl_pl']`.
   Its contribution will be absorbed in the value that you will derive for the systemic RV of the system in each epoch.
