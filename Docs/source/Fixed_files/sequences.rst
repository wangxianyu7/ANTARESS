Sequences
=========

Motivation
----------

Sequences allow you to run ``ANTARESS`` for specific applications, requiring minimal input on your part. They can be useful to peform preliminary analyses and apply the workflow automatically to a large sample of datasets, although we caution that analyzing in detail a given dataset will always require manual configuration of the workflow.  
To exploit the workflow to its full capabilities, run its executable with the `configuration files <https://obswww.unige.ch/~bourriev/antaress/doc/html/Fixed_files/installation.html>`_, customized following the relevant `tutorials <https://obswww.unige.ch/~bourriev/antaress/doc/html/Fixed_files/procedures.html>`__.


How to
------

Follow the instructions given in the `get started <https://obswww.unige.ch/~bourriev/antaress/doc/html/Fixed_files/getting_started.html>`_ page.

The configuration files and inputs specific to each sequence are described in the pages below.
