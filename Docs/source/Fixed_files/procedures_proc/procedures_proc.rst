Processing
==========

``ANTARESS`` tutorials detail how to use the configuration file (which you should have copied in your working directory from the `default configuration file <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/src/antaress/ANTARESS_launch/ANTARESS_settings.py>`_) to carry out a specific procedure. 
Additional options are typically available in this file, so do not hesitate to read it in details. 
``ANTARESS`` plots are activated via the configuration file and have default settings, which can be extensively customized through the plot configuration file (which you should also have copied in your working directory from the `default plot configuration file <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/src/antaress/ANTARESS_plots/ANTARESS_plot_settings.py>`_) 
and detailed in the `plots tutorial <https://obswww.unige.ch/~bourriev/antaress/doc/html/Fixed_files/procedures_plots/procedures_plots.html>`_.

The present tutorial relates to the processing of profile time-series.
The generic term profile designates extracted 2D echelle spectra, order-merged 1D spectra, or cross-correlation functions (CCFs).
We illustrate the tutorial with 2D ESPRESSO spectra of TOI-421c (on 2023-11-06). 

We assume that you have already `set up your system <https://obswww.unige.ch/~bourriev/antaress/doc/html/Fixed_files/procedures_setup/procedures_setup.html>`_ and `reduced <https://obswww.unige.ch/~bourriev/antaress/doc/html/Fixed_files/procedures_reduc/procedures_reduc.html>`_ your spectral transit time-series.
