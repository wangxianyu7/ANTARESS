Pull-requests
=============

You can use one of the following (non-exhaustive) approaches to contribute, after creating your own branch on the project Gitlab page.

- Direct modifications

    Simply add or edit files in your Gitlab branch.

- GitHub desktop

    Generate an access token from the Gitlab project settings.
    
    Copy the https link of your Gitlab repository (from your branch `Code` button).
    
    In GitHub desktop, clone your Gitlab repository by indicating the above URL.
    
    Upon request provide your Gitlab username, and the access token as password.
    
    Fetch origin to retrieve the Gitlab version.
    
    Replace files in your local Gitlab repository with your own edited files, and use GitHub desktop to visualize differences.
    
    Push your local Gitlab repository to your branch. 

- VSCode
    
    Clone the Gitlab repository from your branch.
    
    Edit your branch on your local repository.
    
    Git pull to obtain the state of GitLab version.
    
    Git push to push editions.
    
Once your modifications are done, create a merge request on Gitlab.
