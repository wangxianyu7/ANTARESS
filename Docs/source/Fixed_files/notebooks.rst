Notebooks
=========

Motivation
----------

Notebooks allow you to run simplified versions of the ``ANTARESS`` workflow. Their purpose is to help you familiarize with ``ANTARESS`` and run preliminary analyses. 
To exploit the workflow to its full capabilities, run its executable with the `configuration files <https://obswww.unige.ch/~bourriev/antaress/doc/html/Fixed_files/installation.html>`_.


How to
------

Download ``ANTARESS`` `Notebook directory <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/Notebooks/>`_ 

Install `JupyterLab <https://jupyter.org/install>`_ in the same python environment as ``ANTARESS``.

Launch ``JupyterLab`` from this environment and move to the downloaded Notebook directory. 

Run your chosen notebook among the list below.


Possibilities
-------------

The following notebooks are available:

- `ANTARESS_nbook_setup <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/Notebooks/ANTARESS_nbook_setup.ipynb>`_
    Use to set up the workflow with a real planetary system and dataset.
  `ANTARESS_nbook_setup_Arda <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/Notebooks/ANTARESS_nbook_setup_Arda.ipynb>`_
    Use to set up the workflow with a mock planetary system.

- `ANTARESS_nbook_resolution_maps <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/Notebooks/ANTARESS_nbook_resolution_maps.ipynb>`_
    Use to generate a spectrograph resolution map.

- `ANTARESS_nbook_mock <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/Notebooks/ANTARESS_nbook_mock.ipynb>`_
    Use to generate a mock CCF dataset.

- `ANTARESS_nbook_proc <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/Notebooks/ANTARESS_nbook_proc.ipynb>`_
    Use to process a dataset.

- `ANTARESS_nbook_RMR <https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/antaress/-/blob/main/Notebooks/ANTARESS_nbook_RMR.ipynb>`_
    Use to perform a Rossiter-McLaughlin `Revolutions` of a CCF dataset.
