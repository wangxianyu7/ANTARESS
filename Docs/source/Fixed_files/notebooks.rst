Notebooks
=========

Notebooks allow you to run a simplified version of the ``ANTARESS`` workflow. Their purpose is to help you familiarize with ``ANTARESS``. To exploit the workflow to its full capabilities, use the `configuration file <https://gitlab.unige.ch/bourrier/antaress/-/blob/159abec22b58321e4be190880667205c8728a0b7/src/antaress/ANTARESS_launch/ANTARESS_settings.py>`_.

The following notebooks are available in the namesake `directory <https://gitlab.unige.ch/bourrier/antaress/-/blob/159abec22b58321e4be190880667205c8728a0b7/Notebooks/>`_:
