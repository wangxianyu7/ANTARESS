Notebooks
=========

Notebooks allow you to run a simplified version of the ``ANTARESS`` workflow. Their purpose is to help you familiarize with ``ANTARESS``. To exploit the workflow to its full capabilities, use the `configuration file <https://gitlab.unige.ch/bourrier/antaress/-/tree/0d7232f1a1b39757beb8a52762b9e95fd33b2591/Method/ANTARESS_launch/ANTARESS_settings.py>`_.

The following notebooks are available in the namesake `directory <https://gitlab.unige.ch/bourrier/antaress/-/tree/0d7232f1a1b39757beb8a52762b9e95fd33b2591/Method/Notebooks/>`_:
