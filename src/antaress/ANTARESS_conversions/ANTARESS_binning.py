     - binned profiles are calculated as weighted means with weights specific to the type of profiles
     - binned profiles are used for analysis purposes
     - master profiles used to extract differential profiles from each exposure are calculated in `extract_diff_profiles()`

    #CALIBRATION AND DETECTOR NOISE PROFILES
    #    - the calibration and detector noise profiles, as defined above, are required to estimate the true error and associated weight on the spectral flux density in a given pixel
    #      to this purpose, we measured and formatted those profiles for each exposure in the ANTARESS_calib > calc_gcal() function, following the procedure described below
    #    - furthermore, the calibration profile is also used to scale back temporarily flux values to an equivalent of extracted (blazed) counts, closer to the actual measurements on the detector
    #      because the spectral flux density returned by the DRS are supposed to be comparable, and the calibration profiles we define may not match exactly those applied by the DRS, we do not use the exposure-specific calibration profiles for this scaling to avoid introducing biases in the scaled-back profiles
    #      instead we use a mean profile over all processed visits of a given instrument, thus common to all exposures, defined as gcal(w,t,v) = < t, v :  gcal(w,t,v) > over each independent order
    #    - when blazed spectra are not available, calibration profiles are estimated from input flux and error tables (over each order for S2D and the full spectral range for S1D), and detector noise cannot be estimated
    #      calibration profiles are estimated from the spectral flux density (ie the unblazed profiles returned by the DRS and converted into density):    
    # F_meas(w,t,v) = gcal(w,t,v)*N_meas[bl](w,t,v)
    # EF_meas(w,t,v)^2 ~ gcal(w,t,v)^2*N_meas[bl](w,t,v) since we neglect detector noise      
    #      we can approximate the true flux by the measured flux summed over a large band:
    # TF_meas(band,t,v) ~ TF_true(band,t,v) 
    #                   = sum(w over band, F_true(w,t,v) ) 
    #                   = sum(w over band, gcal(w,t,v)*N_true[bl](w,t,v) ) 
    #                   ~ gcal(band,t,v)*sum(w over band, N_true[bl](w,t,v) )
    #      where we assume that the calibration profile varies with low frequency, ie gcal(w in band,t,v) ~ gcal(band,t,v)   
    #      the associated error is 
    # ETF_meas(t,v)^2 ~ E[ TF_true(t,v) ]^2   
    #                 = E[ gcal(band,t,v)*sum(w over band, N_true[bl](w,t,v) ) ]^2   
    #                 = gcal(band,t,v)^2*E[ sum(w over band, N_true[bl](w,t,v) ) ]^2   
    #                 = gcal(band,t,v)^2*sum(w over band, E[ N_true[bl](w,t,v) )]^2
    #                 = gcal(band,t,v)^2*sum(w over band, N_true[bl](w,t,v) )
    #      calibration profiles can thus be estimated as
    # ETF_meas(t,v)^2 / TF_meas(band,t,v) = gcal(band,t,v)^2*sum(w over band, N_true[bl](w,t,v) ) / ( gcal(band,t,v)*sum(w over band, N_true[bl](w,t,v) ) )
    #                                     = gcal(band,t,v)
    #      in the presence of red noise associated with the measured counts:
    # ETF_meas(t,v)^2 ~ gcal(band,t,v)^2*E[ sum(w over band, N_true[bl](w,t,v) ) ]^2
    #                 = gcal(band,t,v)^2*sum(w over band, E[ N_true[bl](w,t,v) ]^2 + Ered(w)^2 )
    #                 = gcal(band,t,v)^2*sum(w over band, N_true[bl](w,t,v) + Ered(w)^2 )    
    #                 = gcal(band,t,v)^2*( sum(w over band, N_true[bl](w,t,v) ) + TEred(band)^2 )
    #      in practive we are still measuring the calibration as :
    # gcal_meas(band,t,v) = ETF_meas(t,v)^2 / TF_meas(t,v)
    #                     = gcal(band,t,v)^2 *( sum(w over band, N_true[bl](w,t,v) ) + TEred(band)^2 ) / TF_meas(t,v)        
    #                     = gcal(band,t,v)^2 *( TF_meas(t,v)/gcal(band,t,v) + TEred(band)^2 ) / TF_meas(t,v)   
    #                     = gcal(band,t,v) + gcal(band,t,v)^2*TEred(band)^2/ TF_meas(t,v)
    #      so that we are overestimating the true calibration profile (especially in region of low flux), and when scaling back to measured blazed counts as N_meas[bl](w,t,v) = F_meas(w,t,v)/gcal_meas(band) we are underestimating the true measured counts.
    #    - when blazed spectra are available, we first derive the exact blaze profiles applied by the DRS in each exposure as
    # bl(w,t,v) = N_meas[bl](w,t,v)/N_meas(w,t,v) 
    #      where N_meas[bl] is the table returned by the BLAZE files, and N_meas the table returned by the standard files  
    #      we then define the calibration profiles as
    # gcal(w,t,v) = 1/(dw(w)*bl(w,t,v)))
    #      we then derive the detector noise using the blazed counts and error tables from the BLAZE files:
    # EN_meas[bl](w,t,v)^2 = N_meas[bl](w,t,v) + Edet_meas(w,t,v)^2        
    # Edet_meas(w,t,v)^2 = EN_meas[bl](w,t,v)^2 - N_meas[bl](w,t,v)      
    #      since we apply in reverse the operations performed by the DRS to define EN_meas[bl] we retrieve the exact measured detector noise
    #      we however have to approximate Edet_true(w,t,v) ~ Edet_meas(w,t,v), ignoring the underlying bias induced by using 'Ndk_meas' instead of 'Ndk_true' (which we cannot estimate independently)

    #WEIGHING PROFILES    
    #    - what matters for the weighing is the change in the precision on the flux over time in a given pixel:
    # + low-frequency variations linked to the overall flux level of the data (eg due to atmospheric diffusion)
    # + high-frequency variations linked to variations in the spectral flux distribution at the specific wavelength of the pixel
    #   for example when averaging the same spectra in their own rest frame, spectral features do not change and there is no need to weigh
    #   however if there are additional features, such as telluric absorption or stellar lines in transmission spectra, then a given pixel can see large flux variations and weighing is required.  
    #
    #    - extreme care must be taken about the rest frame in which the different elements involved in the weighing profiles are defined
    # + low-frequency components are assumed constant over an order and are not aligned / resampled (eg instrumental calibration, global flux scaling, flux balance and light curve scaling)
    # + high-frequency components must have followed the same shifts and resampling as the weighed profile (eg telluric or master stellar spectrum) 
    #
    #    - weights are normalized within the binning function, so that any factor constant over time will not contribute to the weighing
    #    - planetary signatures are not accounted for when binning disk-integrated and intrinsic stellar spectra because they have been excluded from the data or are considered negligible
    #    - weights are necessarily spectral for intrinsic and atmospheric spectra because of the master 
    #    - the weighing due to integration time is accounted for in the binning routine directly, not through errors but through the fraction of an exposure duration that overlaps with the new bin time window

    Bins input profiles into a new series of profiles, along the chosen dimension
    
     - Propagates variance only
     - Natural weighing by the size of the original bins along the binning dimension
     - Original and final bins can be discontinuous and of different sizes.
       Original bins can overlap and be given as a single input table.
       Input tables must have the same stucture and dimensions, except along the binned dimension .
     - This resampling assumes that the flux density is constant over each pixel, ie that the same number of photons is received by every portion of the pixel.
       In practice this is not the case, as the flux may vary sharply from one pixel to the next, and thus the flux density varies over a pixel (as we would measure at a higher spectral resolution).
       The advantage of the present resampling is that it conserves the flux, which is not necessarily the case for interpolation.
     - nan values can be left in the input tables, so that new pixels that overlap with them will be set conservatively to nan.
       They can also be removed before input to speed up calculation, in which case the new pixel will be defined based on defined, overlapping pixels.
     - If a new pixel is only partially covered by input pixels, its boundaries can be re-adjusted to the maximum overlapping range.
     - The x tables must not contain nan so that they can be sorted.
       The x tables must correspond to the dimension set by dim_bin.

    Otherwise the covariance matrix would need to be resampled over all consecutive pixels, included undefined ones, and the binned pixels would be set to undefined by the resampling function.
