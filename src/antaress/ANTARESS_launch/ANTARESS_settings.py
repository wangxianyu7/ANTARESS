    #      lower components are fitted with a single shift from 'sampbands_shifts', chosen through 'direct_samp'
    #      thus, start by smapling the highest component, and proceed by including lower ones iteratively

    #%%%%% Occulted line exclusion
    #    - exclude range of occulted stellar lines
    #    - all models are assumed to correspond to the disk-integrated star, without planet contamination, with a profile defined as CCFmod(rv,t) = continuum(rv,t)*CCFmod_norm(rv)  
    # + in-transit CCFs are affected by planetary emission, absorption by the planet continuum, and absorption by the planet atmosphere
    #   the narrow, shifting ranges contaminated by the planetary emission and atmospheric absorption can be excluded from the fit and definition of the continuum via data_dic['Atm']['no_plrange'], in which case the CCF approximates as:
    #   CCF(rv,t) = Cref(t)*( CCFstar(rv) - Iocc(rv,t)*alpha(t)*Scont(t) )      where alpha represents low-frequency intensity variations 
    #   because the local stellar line occulted by the planet has a high-frequency profile, in-transit CCFs will not be captured by the CCF model even with the planet masking
    # + if the stellar rotation is truly negligible, we can assume Iocc(rv,t) = I0(rv) and:
    #   CCFstar(rv) = I0(rv)*sum(i,alpha(rv,i)*S(i))          
    #   thus
    #   CCF(rv,t) = Cref(t)*( CCFstar(rv) -CCFstar(rv)*alpha(t)*Scont(t)/sum(i,alpha(rv,i)*S(i)) )    
    #   CCF(rv,t) = Cref(t)*CCFstar(rv)*(1 - Cbias(t) )   
    #   in this case CCFmod can still capture the in-transit CCF profiles, as the bias will be absorbed by continuum(rv,t) that must be left free to vary
    # + however as soon as disk-integrated and intrinsic profiles are not equivalent the above approximation cannot be made
    #   the range that corresponds to the local stellar line absorbed by the planet must be masked, so that outside of the masked regions:
    #   CCF(rv,t) = Cref(t)*( CCFstar(rv) - Icont*alpha(t)*Scont(t) )            
    #   CCF(rv,t) = Cref(t)*( CCFstar(rv) - bias(t) )
    #   in this case CCFmod cannot capture the bias, and a time-dependent offset ('offset' in 'mod_prop') must be included in the model
    #   the continuum flux measured by the pipeline now corresponds to Cref(t)*CCFstar_cont so that it needs to be fitted in addition to the offset
    # + the bias cannot be directly linked with the scaling light curve, because the latter integrates the full intrinsic line profile while Icont is only its continuum
    # + in all cases the continuum range must be defined outside of the range covered by the disk-integrated stellar line 
    # + this method only works if a sufficient portion of the stellar line remains defined after exclusion, ie if the DI line is much larger than the intrinsic one
    #    - the exclusion of occulted stellar lines is only relevant for disk-integrated profiles, and is not proposed for their binning because in-transit profiles will never be equivalent to out-of-transit ones
