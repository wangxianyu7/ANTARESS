However the occulted stellar lines and their derived properties may be so noisy in some exposures, especially at the stellar limbs, that they do not bring any constraint to the fits. It also happens that the planet only occults the star for a small fraction of the ingress/egress exposure, as in the example mock dataset, so that the model planet does not transit. In that case, you can change `idx_in_fit` to the list of indexes indicating which exposures to fit (indexes are counted from 0 from the first in-transit exposure). \n",
    "\n",
    "If the star is too faint or the planet too small, the properties may all be derived with a precision that is too low to analyze them here. In that case, you can apply directly the Revolutions fit with the simplest models to describe these properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in this notebook we are using a simple Gaussian profile to fit the intrinsic lines. Although this model includes instrumental convolution, it is an approximation compared to using ANTARESS numerical stellar grid to simulate realistic line profiles, as is done when applying the RM Revolutions fit. Here we do not account in particular for the blurring induced by the planet motion, which is significant for long exposure times and fast-rotators. Use the configuration file if you want to fit more finely individual intrinsic profiles. "
